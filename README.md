### Calculation Steps:
1. **Percentage Change Calculation:** For each selected stock, the indicator calculates the daily percentage change in closing price.
2. **Cumulative Performance:** These daily changes are compounded to derive a cumulative performance metric for each stock.
3. **Average Variation:** The average of these cumulative performances is computed to represent the overall trend.
4. **Global Liquidity Adjustment:** The index factors in the Global Liquidity Index and M2 Money Supply to adjust the trend forecast based on economic liquidity.
5. **Correlation with VIX:** By analyzing the correlation with the VIX, the indicator accounts for market volatility in its trend forecast.
6. **Final Trend Forecast:** The aggregated data is used to plot the War Index, providing a visual representation of market trends influenced by defense sector performance and economic conditions.
